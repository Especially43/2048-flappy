## 🕹️ About the Game

**2048 Flappy** is a fun and creative mashup of two iconic games — **Flappy Bird** and **2048**. In this unique hybrid, you guide a numbered tile through obstacles, and every successful pass combines tiles to reach higher numbers, just like in the original 2048 game. The further you go, the higher the number — and the challenge.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎮 Addictive gameplay combining Flappy Bird physics and 2048 logic.
- 🔢 Merge tiles by flying through matching gates.
- 🌐 Playable online — no installation required.
- 📱 Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

## 📍 How to Play

1. Tap the screen or click to flap and keep your tile in the air.
2. Pass through gates with matching numbers to merge and double your score.
3. Try to reach the elusive **2048** tile or go beyond!
4. Avoid crashing into gates or flying off-screen.
